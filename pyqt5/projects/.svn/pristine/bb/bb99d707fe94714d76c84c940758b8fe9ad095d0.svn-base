To open the Qt Designer you must have qt5-tools installed and use the following command:

Once the GUI is designed it is saved as a file with .ui extension.
This file can be converted to a python program by using the pyuic5 tool.  for example:

pyuic5 -x basic_frames.ui -o fc.py

Then the program can be executed by 

python3 fc.py
