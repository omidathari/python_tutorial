PyQt5
install: 

pip3 install PyQt5

pip3 install pyqt5-tools

To open the Qt Designer you must have qt5-tools installed and use the following command:

qt5-tools designer

Once the GUI is designed it is saved as a file with .ui extension.
This file can be converted to a python program by using the pyuic5 tool.  for example:

pyuic5 -x gui-1.ui -o gui-1.py

Then the program can be executed by 

python3 gui-1.py
